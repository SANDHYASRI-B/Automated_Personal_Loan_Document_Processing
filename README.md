# About the project - Automated_Personal_Loan_Document_Processing

# Problem Statement
Banks process numerous personal loan applications, often requiring manual data entry from various documents. This process is time-consuming and error-prone. The solution leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to automate the extraction of relevant information, improving efficiency and accuracy.

# Objective
Develop an OCR-based system to automatically extract key fields from personal loan documents, including:
- Applicant Name
- Address
- Income Details
- Loan Amount

# Requirements
- Data Collection: Gather a sample set of personal loan documents.
- Preprocessing: Enhance image readability (noise reduction, contrast adjustment).
- OCR Implementation: Use OCR libraries to extract text and identify key fields.
- Data Validation: Implement checks for accuracy.
- User  Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for document uploads and data review.
